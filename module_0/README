Game "Guess A Number!"

Description:

  Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.


Condition:

- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By “guessing,” of course, is meant “writing a program that guesses a   number.”
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.


Quality metric:

  The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions


Decision:

  With each attempt, we will halve the range of finding the desired number by half.


Result:

  Our algorithm guesses the number on average in 5 attempts.
