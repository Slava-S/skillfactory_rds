Game "Guess A Number!"

Condition:

The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By “guessing,” of course, is meant “writing a program that guesses a number.”

Decision:

With each attempt, we will halve the range of finding the desired number by half.

Result:

Our algorithm guesses the number on average in 5 attempts.
